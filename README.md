# Wordle in React

Welcome to my Wordle App, created using <b>React</b> and <b>Tailwind CSS</b>. This application replicates the popular word-guessing game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. The app provides visual feedback after each guess, indicating correctly guessed letters and their positions.

## Data Source

This Wordle App does not utilize a database or backend server. Instead, all data is sourced from a local JSON file. The game words are stored in an array within data/words.json, consisting of approximately 331 random words.

## Getting Started

In the root directory, run:

```console
npm i
```

Once dependencies are installed, run

```console
npm run dev
```

You should be able to view via localhost ([http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)).
